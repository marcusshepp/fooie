lookup:
- twisted webservers
- websockets

get public boolean working with permissions

tumblr idea:
- have many people able to upload any content related to the Hub catagory.

likes/dislikes:
- each hub post can be liked/disliked.
- 3 dislikes results in archived post
- can view all archived posts

short urls:
- quick access to Hubs

passphrases
- (secret keys)

being apart of a hub:
- need to create a way for the UI to add Users to Hubs
-   >>> from registration.models import User
	>>> user = User.objects.get(username="pop")
	>>> user
	<User: pop>
	>>> from hubtubapp.models import Hub
	>>> user.hub_set.add(Hub.objects.all()[0])
	>>>
- when viewing a hub that that isnt in user.hub_set.all()
	- prompt for Hub.secret_key
	- if form.cleaneddata['secret_key'] == Hub.secret_key:
		- request.user.hub_set.add(self.object)
- currently
	- after correct secretkey user is redirected to hub/#/permission


ajax after making new post

lamp for pi server

login/out:
-	correct redirect/responses
-	sometimes when logging in the url will be account/logout thus cant submit form to login
